      <description>Truth be told, whenever i win at &amp;ldquo;Risk&amp;rdquo;, it is my belief it was not luck but my strategic calculus. Itï¿½s a pity my opponents had a hard time understanding that. The only way to prove it would be to log and calculate it. That introduced the question whether it is possible (with my preferred tech stack). At that point of time a few of todays R Shiny features were not introduced so I had to find a hacky way to track the clicks on a map.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;If you can&amp;rsquo;t explain it simply, you don&amp;rsquo;t understand it well enough.&amp;rdquo;
Fan of asking right questions that partner derives core idea by himself.
Decision Trees:
Decision Trees is much like the &amp;ldquo;Who am I?&amp;rdquo; game.
If i am asked to explain decision trees to non-statisticans I like to let them play a game of &amp;ldquo;Who am I?&amp;rdquo; and let them do guess role with side rule to take as least guesses as possible.</description>
