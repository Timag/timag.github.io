      <description>Before every great family vacation there comes a great family discussion: Where to go? We are mountain people. Even born and raised in northern Germany my brother and I spent 8 weeks a year, almost all our vacations, in the Alps for way over 20 years. Nothing compared to our parents (40&amp;frasl;50) years. A lot of experience, a lot of opinions on where we could avoid the increasing amount of green hills in the Alps but still stay away from avalanches.</description>

      <description>Granny Who? Some time ago I read about (the image analysis framework of) Tensorflow and gave it a shot. Following some tutorials, I set up the framework until it was ready to be fed with a picture. I quickly googled the first thing coming to my mind, an apple and saved the picture. Then it was time to test it: Would the program be good enough? An apple shouldnt be that hard to recognize,&amp;hellip; The program finished within seconds and the top result was &amp;ldquo;Granny Smith&amp;rdquo;.</description>
