      <description>Before every great family vacation there comes a great family discussion: Where to go? We are mountain people. Even born and raised in northern Germany my brother and I spent 8 weeks a year, almost all our vacations, in the Alps for way over 20 years. Nothing compared to our parents (40&amp;frasl;50) years. A lot of experience, a lot of opinions on where we could avoid the increasing amount of green hills in the Alps but still stay away from avalanches.</description>

      <description>This site, big-data-scientist.de is written with blogdown. https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown. The package and the documentation are still under development (07.2017), but it works already great. I would like to contribute a quick-start tutorial, as i feel that could help some interested follower to get an overview. VIDEO. For a full tutorial see here: https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/.</description>

      <description>Granny Who? Some time ago I read about (the image analysis framework of) Tensorflow and gave it a shot. Following some tutorials, I set up the framework until it was ready to be fed with a picture. I quickly googled the first thing coming to my mind, an apple and saved the picture. Then it was time to test it: Would the program be good enough? An apple shouldnt be that hard to recognize,&amp;hellip; The program finished within seconds and the top result was &amp;ldquo;Granny Smith&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <title>Shiny Risk. Statistical significant wins.</title>

      <description>Truth be told, whenever i win at &amp;ldquo;Risk&amp;rdquo;, it is my belief it was not luck but my strategic calculus. Itï¿½s a pity my opponents had a hard time understanding that. The only way to prove it would be to log and calculate it. That introduced the question whether it is possible (with my preferred tech stack). At that point of time a few of todays R Shiny features were not introduced so I had to find a hacky way to track the clicks on a map.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;If you can&amp;rsquo;t explain it simply, you don&amp;rsquo;t understand it well enough.&amp;rdquo;
Fan of asking right questions that partner derives core idea by himself.
Decision Trees:
Decision Trees is much like the &amp;ldquo;Who am I?&amp;rdquo; game.
If i am asked to explain decision trees to non-statisticans I like to let them play a game of &amp;ldquo;Who am I?&amp;rdquo; and let them do guess role with side rule to take as least guesses as possible.</description>
